class ComponentWrapper:

    """Abstract class that contains some common functionality for all
    tarsqi component wrappers. Each Tarsqi component has a Python
    ComponentWrapper. Wrappers are responsible for (i) extracting from
    the XML document those fragments that need to be processed, (ii)
    asking the component to process each fragment and (iii) inserting
    the processed fragments back into the XML document. The parsed XML
    document lives in the document instance variable and results are
    inserted into that same document. The wrapper does not know where
    the input and output files are. However, each wrapper does keep
    track of where the input and output fragments are for its
    component (in the DIR_DATA directory with fixed extensions).

    Instance variables for all subclasses of ComponentWrapper:

       tarsqi_instance - a TarsqiControl instance
       tag - a string indicating the content tag used to create
             fragments
       document - the XML document of the input file
       fragments - a list of fragments
       trap_errors - True|False
       DIR_DATA - directory where fragments are written to

       component_name - string indicating the name of the wrapped
                        component
       CREATION_EXTENSION - extension of fragment that is the input to
                            the wrapped component
       RETRIEVAL_EXTENSION - extension of fragment that is the output
                             of the wrapped component
       TMP_EXTENSION - extension of intermediate files, if used

    The last four variables are instantiated by the __init__ methods
    defined on the subclasses of ComponentWrapper. In addition, those
    subclasses may initialise (1) a directory where the executables for
    the wrapped components are, which is needed for the non-Python
    components, and (2) an instance of the component parser."""

    # - wrappers now use files as input and output, this may be changed
    #   to using in-memory strings to reduce disk operations
    # - may want to look at all the extension that are used, there may be
    #   some overlap.
    # - the tarsqi_instance vriable was added later, with it, we may
    #   want to get rid of some of the other ones
