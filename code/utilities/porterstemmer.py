    """Porter Stemming Algorithm

    This is the Porter stemming algorithm, ported to Python from the
    version coded up in ANSI C by the author. It may be be regarded as
    canonical, in that it follows the algorithm presented in

        Porter, 1980, An algorithm for suffix stripping, Program,
        Vol. 14, no. 3, pp 130-137,

    only differing from it at the points maked --DEPARTURE-- below.

    See also http://www.tartarus.org/~martin/PorterStemmer

    The algorithm as described in the paper could be exactly
    replicated by adjusting the points of DEPARTURE, but this is
    barely necessary, because (a) the points of DEPARTURE are
    definitely improvements, and (b) no encoding of the Porter stemmer
    I have seen is anything like as exact as this version, even with
    the points of DEPARTURE!

    Release 1: January 2001

    NOTE: this is a heavily dressed down version of the Porter stemmer,
    only the step that strips plurals is left in (Marc Verhagen, 2005).
