# Rule 2: EVENT - SIGNAL - TIMEX
# ==============================
#
# - intra-sentential EVENT-TIMEX3 pairs
# - SIGNAL occuring between EVENT and TIMEX3

# Implied Features:
#
#  - arg1.tag = EVENT
#  - arg2.tag = TIMEX3
#  - sameSentence = YES
#
# Other features:
#
#  - signal = <string>
#  - relation = <TimemlRel>
#	any timeml relation
#  - confidence = <float>
#	always 1 if rules have not been trained,
#	otherwise a number from 0 to 1
